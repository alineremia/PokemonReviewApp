Sample .NET Web API app for learning purposes.

Used Teddy Smmith's tutorial as a baseline, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8nLSsK5NDo&list=PL82C6-O4XrHdiS10BLh23x71ve9mQCln0&ab_channel=TeddySmith

I wwould like to further develop this app by:
- Adding a GUI in Angular
- Convert to CosmosDB
- Deploy it in Azure (serverless if possible)
